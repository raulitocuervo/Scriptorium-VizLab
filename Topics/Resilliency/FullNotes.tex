\section{Resiliency Experiment 1}\label{res:1}
This section presents the first experiment conducted to evaluate the role of resiliency in network automation. The experiment focuses on the integration of advanced fault tolerance and rapid recovery mechanisms within the Zero-touch Service Management (ZSM) framework. The objective is to assess how these technologies contribute to optimizing network operations and enabling autonomous decision-making processes.
