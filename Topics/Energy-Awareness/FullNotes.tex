\section{Energy-Awareness Experiment 1}\label{awar:1}
This is my starting point \cite{3gpp-ts-22-186,3gpp_ts_26_511_v18_1_0}

Every physical capability of the \gls{rsu} is different from each other in terms of maximum wattage.
When the \glspl{rsu} were stressed based on the amount of vehicles, they have a limit of watts also linked to the CPU consumption.

Table~\ref{tab:rsu-max-capacity} summarizes the maximum number of users (U) and the corresponding maximum wattage (W) capacity for each \gls{rsu}. As shown, \gls{rsu} 5 supports the highest number of vehicles and reaches a higher power consumption compared to the others. This variation highlights the heterogeneous nature of the \glspl{rsu} in the testbed. Figure~\ref{fig:exp1-figure} visually presents the relationship between the number of vehicles and the power consumption for each \gls{rsu}, illustrating how the power usage increases with the load and reaches a plateau at the maximum capacity.

Max vehicles registered: 39 \gls{rsu} 5
