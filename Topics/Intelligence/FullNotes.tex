\section{Intelligence Experiment 1}\label{int:1}
This section presents the first experiment conducted to evaluate the role of intelligence in network automation. The experiment focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) functions within the Zero-touch Service Management (ZSM) framework. The objective is to assess how these technologies contribute to optimizing network operations and enabling autonomous decision-making processes.
